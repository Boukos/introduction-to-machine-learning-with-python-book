    " - *Nearest Neighbors* - For small datasets, good as a baseline, easy to explain\n",
    " - *Linear models* - Go-to as a first algorithm to try, good for very large datasets, good for very high-dimensional data\n",
    " - *Naive Bayes* - Only for classification.  Even faster than linear models.  Good for very large datasets and high-dimensional data.  Often less accurate than linear models.\n",
    " - *Decision Trees* - Very fast, don't need scaling of the data, can be visualized and easily explained\n",
    " - *Random Forests* - Performs better than a single tree, very robust and powerful.  Don't need scaling of the data.  Not good for very high-dimensional sparse data.\n",
    " - *Gradient Boosted Decision Tree* - Slightly more accurate than random forests.  Slower to train but faster to predict than random forests, smaller in memory.  Need more parameter tuning than RF.\n",
    " - *Support Vector Machines* - Powerful for medium-sized datasets of features with similar meaning.  Require scaling of data, sensitive to parameters.\n",
    " - *Neural Networks* - Can build very complex models, particularly for large datasets.  Sensitive to scaling of the data and to the choice of parameters.  Large models need a long time to train."
